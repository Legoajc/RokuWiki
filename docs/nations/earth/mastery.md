# Earthbending

Earth is the element of substance, if you want to be able to control it and bend it to your will you need a great deal of strength, durability and endurance. Earthbenders should seek to master the art of creating powerful stances in order to provide their body and mind with the essential stability and stamina required of a skilled bender. Unlike other elements, earthbending prospers when the bender waits and listens for the precise moment to attack. Those who are well versed in bending the element will learn to endure attacks until the perfect opportunity to counterattack reveals itself to them.
