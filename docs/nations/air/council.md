# Air Council System

## Overview of the Council System

The Air Collective is divided into 4 locations:

- Eastern Air Temple
- Southern Air Temple
- Western Air Temple
- Gyantse Village

Each location is independent and run by its own council. The councils consist of a leader who is an Abbot, Abbess or Mayor, and 2 senior Monks or Nuns.

The people elect an Abbot, Abbess or Mayor through a vote. The elected leaders have a four-month grace period; after that, other political opponents may challenge them to an election. 

It is the responsibility of the Air Representative to communicate with the other nations and travel to each temple to monitor wellbeing. Additionally, they discuss topics with the councils but hold no power over them.
