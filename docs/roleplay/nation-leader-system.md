# Nation Leader Responsibilities, Requirements, and Elections

## Responsibilities of a Nation Leader

A Nation Leader is required to actively lead and drive roleplay within their nation. They are role models for players to look up to for roleplay. More specific tasks include:

- Collaborate with members of their nation to create and push exciting storylines
- Organise, assist with and encourage roleplay events
- Communicate with other Nation Leaders and the playerbase to improve the current state of roleplay
- Process roleplay applications

## Requirements to Run for a Nation Leader Position

- You must have a character introduction
- Players who have seriously or repeatedly broken server rules must be approved by staff if they wish to run for a NL position

## Elections

1. Elections for a new Nation Leader will occur every four months (the end of each roleplay year) for all four nations.
2. Candidates will put forward their name and campaign for one week through the #elections channel in the Roleplay Hub discord. Voting will take place after this period. Threads will be used in the #elections channel for candidate Q&As.
3. The Rokucraft Admin team will distribute a voting form in the Rokucraft Roleplay Hub discord server (https://discord.gg/tjqX25pH37). The form will be open for three days. Players will be able to vote for all candidates that they favour and/or to re-open nominations (RON). It will only allow players to fill out the form once and will ask players for their username. After the three-day voting period is over, the results will be announced and duties will be transferred.
4. If there are no candidates for a Nation Leader position, it will be left empty and the other Nation Leaders will manage OOC affairs.

## Inactivity

If a Nation Leader is unable to lead (e.g. due to personal circumstances), their councils will inherit their duties until the next election. They will be able to handle character applications and lead the nation. Although, if the Nation Leader returns at any point during their term, they will be put back in charge. It will be at the discretion of the council to determine whether the Nation Leader is inactive or not. If the Nation Leader is deemed inactive, the council should notify them (e.g. ping in council chat or direct message).
