# Bending Mastery

For a character to become a master of their element they must complete an average of 10 roleplay lessons (8 minimum) depending on their current skill level, age, and ability. 

There are two types of bending instructor:

- **Masters** have completed all lessons and have an accepted mastery application
- **Teachers** have completed any of the first 5 lessons of their element and can pass this knowledge on to others

The first 5 lessons can be completed with a master *or* teacher *or* mix of both. The last 5 lessons must be completed with a master. 8/10 lessons minimum must be completed on the server. 2/10 can be in the [Roleplay Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/tjqX25pH37) if necessary.

- If a master is taking on a student that has already completed some lessons with another teacher, the master should confirm this with the teacher OOC.

## Role of Bending Instructors

- Masters and teachers have a loose lesson plan to follow when teaching and can determine if a character will need more or less training based on skill level and progress shown. The structure is flexible depending on the teacher or master’s teaching style and the student's interests and needs. 
- Instructors have a channel in the Roleplay Hub Discord where they can share training ideas and more detailed guides to specific lessons. Bending instructors will be responsible for communicating their student's progress in this channel. 
- When a student applies for mastery, their bending instructors must reply to the application to confirm that they have completed the required lessons.

## Lesson Structure

- Masters will be able to opt in to receiving a `Master` tag in the Roleplay Hub. This will give access to a `#master` channel to discuss teaching and allows players to seek out masters.

** Each element has moves classed as master level. [Water](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Waterbending#Waterbending_master_level), [Earth](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Earthbending#Earthbending_master_level), and [Fire](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Firebending#Firebending_master_level) students can choose to learn 2 of them as part of their training.*

## General lesson ideas:
- Customize to suit student’s needs
    - more or less trainings required based on skills
- Unique training experiences
    - e.g. trip with master to interesting location that suits a specific skill (like a certain firebender’s unique lightning experience)
- Complete lessons with multiple students
    - more people to RP with and get to know
- Sparring
    - Could be briefly at the end of some training sessions
    - Outside mastery training with friends

## Finding a teacher
It is highly encouraged that you to seek out bending instructors through active roleplay. However, if your character cannot find one, you can look for a player with the `Instructor` tag in the Roleplay Hub Discord and contact them about training. You can then arrange to have your characters meet in a natural way that makes sense for them both.
