# Bending Mastery Proposal

For a character to become a master of their element they must complete an average of 10 roleplay lessons (8 minimum) depending on their current skill level, age, and ability. 

There will be 2 types of people who can train others:

- **Masters** have completed their mastery training and have an accepted mastery application
- **Teachers** have completed certain basic lessons and can pass this knowledge on to others

The first 5 lessons can be completed with a master *or* teacher *or* mix of both. The **last 5** lessons must be completed with a master. 8/10 lessons minimum must be completed on the server. 2/10 can be in the Roleplay Hub Discord if necessary.

---

Masters and teachers will have a loose structure (see table below) to follow when teaching and can determine if a character will need more or less training based on skill level and progress shown. The structure will be flexible depending on the master’s teaching style and the students’ needs. Masters can have more detailed guides to specific trainings in a channel, and can share ideas, what they like to do, and what works well with the other masters.

- If a master is taking on a student that has already completed some lessons with a regular teacher, the master should confirm this with the player OOC.

The master(s) will be responsible for communicating their students’ progress in a channel (accessible to all masters) and will vouch for their student when they apply for mastery.

- Masters will be able to opt in to receiving a `Master` tag in the Roleplay Hub. This will give access to a `#master` channel to discuss teaching and allows players to seek out masters.

** Each element has moves classed as master level. [Water](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Waterbending#Waterbending_master_level), [Earth](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Earthbending#Earthbending_master_level), and [Fire](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Firebending#Firebending_master_level) students can choose to learn 2 of them as part of their training.*

General lesson ideas:

---

- Customize to suit student’s needs
    - more or less trainings required based on skills
- Unique training experiences
    - e.g. trip with master to interesting location that suits a specific skill (like a certain firebender’s unique lightning experience)
- Complete lessons with multiple students
    - more people to RP with and get to know
- Sparring
    - Could be briefly at the end of some training sessions
    - Outside mastery training with friends
