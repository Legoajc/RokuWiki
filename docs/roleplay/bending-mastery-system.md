# Bending Mastery

## Becoming a Master

For a character to become a master of their element they must complete an average of 10 roleplay lessons, minimum 8, depending on their current skill level, age, and ability. A minimum of 8/10 lessons must be completed on the server. 2/10 can be in the [Roleplay Hub](https://discord.gg/tjqX25pH37) if necessary. Once completed, fill out the mastery application on the [forum](https://forum.rokucraft.com/) using the template provided.

    ## Knowledge Showcase

    Present a lesson plan [finish desc]

    Please respond in character to one of the following scenarios. Choose one that will help showcase your character's relevant skills and creativity! You may respond to both scenarios if you wish.

    1. You're taking a leisurely stroll through a forest outside a town when you hear voices up ahead. You cautiously approach the source of the noise and spot a group of people. They appear to be discussing a plan of some sort. A few of them carry weapons, and you can tell they're looking for a fight. You don't know anything about their intentions or abilities, but you can tell from their posture and attitude that they're confident and skilled. There are no other people in sight and suddenly one member of the group spots you. What do you do?

    2. Practical: Your character must use their bending abilities to solve a practical problem. Showcase your resourcefulness and creativity by applying your bending to real-world situations. You may use one of the following examples or create your own similar scenario.
    - divert a river to irrigate farmland or prevent a flood
    - construct a new path/bridge or clear a path through an obstacle
    - contain an out of control fire
    - guide a ship through rough seas

    Your instructors(s) must reply to this post to vouch for you. Please ask them to do this.

There are two types of bending instructor:

- **Masters** have completed all lessons and have an accepted mastery application
- **Teachers** have completed any of the first 5 lessons and can pass this knowledge on to others

## Role of Bending Instructors

- Follow the lesson structure when teaching and determine if a character will need more or less training based on skill level and progress shown. The structure is flexible depending on teaching style and the student's interests. 
- Use the `#instructors` channel in the Roleplay Hub to share training ideas, more detailed guides to specific lessons, and communicate students' progress.
- When a student applies for mastery, reply to the application to confirm which lessons you have taught them and if you think they are ready to be a master.

## Finding an Instructor

Players are encouraged to find bending instructors through roleplay. However, if your character cannot find one, you can look for a player with the `Instructor` tag in the Roleplay Hub and contact them about training. Bending teachers and masters can choose to have this tag if they would like to be contacted by others. You can then arrange to have your characters meet in a realistic way.

## Lesson Structure

The first 5 lessons can be completed with a master *or* teacher *or* mix of both. The last 5 lessons must be completed with a master. [Water](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Waterbending#Waterbending_master_level), [Earth](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Earthbending#Earthbending_master_level), and [Fire](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Firebending#Firebending_master_level) have moves classed as master level. Students can choose to learn two of these as part of their mastery training.

### Water
Waterbending students can choose to follow either the traditional, or healing path to mastery. If choosing the healing path, offensive lessons will be replaced by healing lessons. For practical waterbending or history and culture, the lesson can relate specifically to the character's Clan if applicable.
