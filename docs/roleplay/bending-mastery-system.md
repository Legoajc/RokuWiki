# Bending Mastery

For a character to become a master of their element they must complete an average of 10 roleplay lessons (8 minimum) depending on their current skill level, age, and ability. 

There are two types of bending instructor:

- **Masters** have completed all lessons and have an accepted mastery application
- **Teachers** have completed any of the first 5 lessons of their element and can pass this knowledge on to others

The first 5 lessons can be completed with a master *or* teacher *or* mix of both. The last 5 lessons must be completed with a master. 8/10 lessons minimum must be completed on the server. 2/10 can be in the [Roleplay Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/tjqX25pH37) if necessary.

- If a master is taking on a student that has already completed some lessons with another teacher, the master should confirm this with the teacher OOC.

## Role of Bending Instructors

- Follow the lesson structure when teaching and determine if a character will need more or less training based on skill level and progress shown. The structure is flexible depending on teaching style and the student's interests. 
- Use the channel in the Roleplay Hub Discord to share training ideas and more detailed guides to specific lessons. Communicate student's progress in this channel. 
- When a student applies for mastery, reply to the application to confirm that they have completed the required lessons.

## Finding an Instructor

Players are encouraged to find bending instructors through roleplay. However, if your character cannot find one, you can look for a player with the `Instructor` tag in the Roleplay Hub and contact them about training. Bending teachers and masters will have this tag if they would like people to contact them about training. You can then arrange to have your characters meet in a realistic way.
